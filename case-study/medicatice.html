<h2>Making drug inserts more accessible</h2>
<img src="../photos/thumbnail_medicatice-min.webp">
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>This mission was carried out individually in the school setting in 3 sessions of 3h30 for the Digital Campus Lyon school. The exercise was initiated by Louis Gounon, innovation project manager for ExoFlow.</p>
<h3>Result</h3>
<p>✷ Better understanding of risks (70% of users would first go to the drug risk category).<br><br>

  ✷ Better understanding of routes of administration (67% of users said they understood the routes of administration better than on a paper insert).</p>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>Medication inserts are long and cumbersome. This can be problematic insofar as it is imperative to read them in the context of an important drug treatment. The hopital.fr website reveals that 33% of French people do not read or do not read the instructions.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
  I conducted 10 interviews with the administration and students of the Digital Campus school, here is what they said: <br><br>
    
  1. "The paper format is really not practical, it doesn't make me want to take the time to read"<br><br>
    
  2. "I have a really hard time finding the information I'm looking for, generally speaking I look for risks first."</p>     
    <h3>Goal</h3>    
    <p>So I was able, through all of its elements, to identify a problem to keep a framework: 
      "How can we enable users of drug treatments to be more knowledgeable about their treatments?"</p>   
        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>From this problem, several ideas came out, the first one was to totally rethink the information architecture of the paper record. The problem with this one is that the paper medium is a problem in itself. Option 2 was to display the records in an application format, splitting the information as best as possible, while keeping the same content. I kept this option.</p>
        <h3>Wireframe</h3>
        <p>From this idea, I was able to start creating the first wireframes.</p>
        <img src="../photos/wireframe_medicatice-min.webp" alt="wireframe"/>
        <h3>User flow </h3>
        <p>In order to best define the needs of the users, and to be sure not to take the wrong path, we had to imagine the different possible paths.</p>
        <img src="../photos/user_flow_medicatice-min.webp" alt="user flow"/>
        <h3>Hi-fi design</h3>
        <p>After a conclusive test phase on the wireframes, I could start the high-fidelity design.</p>
        <img src="../photos/hi_fi_medicatice-min.webp" alt="hi-fi"/>
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>On a technical level, I was able to understand the impact of the wireframe and how useful it was to design a fair solution.

          I also learned that it was sometimes necessary to design less to get to the point and that some functionalities were not essential and that it was better to have one solution to answer a problem correctly, rather than trying to implement several solutions to answer a need in a moderate way.</p>
